\section{\sc Research Interests}
I am interested in developing programming language based techniques
that help developers design and build robust software in real world
settings.  In particular, I am interested in making advanced
type-theoretic verification and design techniques more accessible to
developers of all levels.

\section{\sc Skills}
Research in programming language theory and formal logic, functional
and imperative programming, experience with the Unix environment and a
variety of programming languages/tools (Racket, Coq, C/C++, Agda,
Java, Python, git, etc).
